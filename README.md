# Linux Shell Challenges – HackerRank

Welcome to my repository of **Linux Shell** solutions from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)!  
This repo contains completed scripts for various Bash and text processing challenges designed to sharpen skills in shell programming, command-line utilities, and Unix scripting.

## 📚 About the Challenge Set

HackerRank's **Linux Shell** domain offers a variety of hands-on coding challenges that explore the full potential of shell scripting and related command-line tools. These challenges help learners improve their ability to:

- Manipulate and transform text using standard utilities
- Write efficient Bash scripts using conditionals and loops
- Use advanced commands such as `cut`, `tr`, `sort`, `uniq`, `awk`, `sed`, and more
- Handle arrays and arithmetic in Bash
- Understand piping, redirection, and subshells
- Solve practical problems using Unix philosophy

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

These challenges cover core areas of shell scripting:

- 📄 **Text Processing:** `cut`, `tr`, `sort`, `uniq`, `paste`, `head`, `tail`
- 🔁 **Loops & Conditionals:** `for`, `while`, `if`, `case`, `&&`, `||`
- 🔢 **Arithmetic & Comparisons:** Using `expr`, `bc`, and built-in operators
- 🧰 **Utilities & Commands:** `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `xargs`, `find`, etc.
- 🗃️ **Arrays in Bash:** Iteration, indexing, and manipulation
- 📤 **Standard I/O Handling:** Input redirection, output formatting

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Bash shell (GNU Bash 4+)**
- **Unix/Linux environment**
- **Shell scripting utilities** (`awk`, `sed`, `cut`, etc.)
- Solutions are tested and compatible with the HackerRank execution environment.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each file corresponds to an individual HackerRank Linux Shell challenge. The filenames are typically based on the challenge title or topic. For example:

```
.
├── lets-echo.sh
├── looping-and-skipping.sh
├── personalized-echo.sh
├── cut-1.sh
├── cut-2.sh
├── comparing-numbers.sh
├── conditionals-1.sh
├── arrays-in-bash.sh
└── world-of-numbers.sh
```

Each script includes:
- Comments explaining the logic where necessary
- Clean and efficient code
- Bash shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) where applicable

---

## 🚀 How to Use

You can run any of the scripts locally (if you have Bash installed):

```bash
bash cut-7.sh
```

If needed, give execution permission:

```bash
chmod +x cut-7.sh
./cut-7.sh
```

You can also redirect input for challenges that require `stdin`:

```bash
echo "your input here" | bash challenge-name.sh
```
